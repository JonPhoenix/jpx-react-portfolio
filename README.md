## Project Description

A selection of web applications showcasing the broad palette of **full-stack web development technologies, and UI/UX skills** that define my process. Proudly featuring **"5 Sherpas", "Breakaway", and "Discover Serenity"**, the remarkably creative result of a team collaboration as a member of **MVC-5**, a group of full-stack web developers. This portfolio features relevant technologies such as **JavaScript**, HTML, CSS, SQL / NoSQL Databases, **MERN: Mongo, Express, Node, React,** and polished UI interfaces.

Every featured project presents a brief description, and functional buttons to launch the live application and to see the code repository. The navigation bar features a link to download a copy of my **Resume** and the footer includes links to my main internet handles on Github, LinkedIn, my Design Portfolio and a link to contact me by email. This updated portfolio has been created with **React** and deployed from **Heroku**.
